## 🚀 Project: Nexus CMS

### What Makes It Stand Out

**1. Goes Beyond Basic CRUD**
- Traditional CRUD: Create → Read → Update → Delete
- Nexus CMS: Create (with AI) → Read (with analytics) → Update (with versioning) → AI Optimize → Publish → Analyze → Delete (soft)

**2. Real-World Problem Solving**
- **Problem**: Content teams struggle with SEO optimization, consistency, and efficiency
- **Solution**: AI-powered CMS that automates summarization, SEO, and content analysis
- **Impact**: Saves hours per article, improves content quality, increases engagement

**3. Sophisticated Technical Implementation**
- Multi-role authentication (ADMIN, EDITOR, VIEWER)
- 4 AI features (summarization, SEO, sentiment, tags)
- Real-time analytics dashboard
- Media management with cloud storage
- Advanced security and optimization
